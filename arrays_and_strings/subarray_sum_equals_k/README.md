Given an array of integers and an integer `k`, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to `k`.

Example 1:

- Input: `nums = [1,1,1]`, `k = 2`
- Output: `2`

Note:
- The length of the array is in range `[1, 20,000]`.
- The range of numbers in the array is `[-1000, 1000]` and the range of the integer k is `[-1e7, 1e7]`.
